### Contributions
- Aaron Yang
  - Created intial classes, ENUMs, and interfaces as well as the attributes and method sigantures for these as well. As well as getters and setters.
  - Intial paramterized and copy construictors for the Pizza types, also made modifications to them aswell.
  - Created the toString() for AbstractPizza.
  - Created implementations for the below methods:
    - `public boolean cook(AbstractPizza pizza)`, for each startegy of ICoookingStrategy.

    - `public abstract double updatePizzaPrice()`, for each Pizza type.
- Zach Snyder
  - Wrote `printPizzaOrderCart` and `printListOfToppingsByPizzaOrderID` and `addPizzaToCart` and made changes to fix the constructors based off errors I encountered while writing my part.
  - Also wrote the `PizzaOrder constructor` and `printListOfToppingsByOrderId`.
